# Web Component: Podcast Preview

## Overview

In this project, I will build a reusable and encapsulated **custom HTML element** that displays a podcast preview. The component must follow the **Web Component standard**, using `customElements.define()` and should work independently from the main application logic. This component will enhance modularity, promote reuse, and reduce code duplication across the app.

The component should be designed to **accept podcast data via attributes or properties**, display relevant UI elements (such as title, cover image, and genres), and **communicate with the main application** through custom events.
